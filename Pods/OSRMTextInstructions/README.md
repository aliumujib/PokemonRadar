OSRM Text Instructions is a library for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications written in Swift 3 or Objective-C that transforms [OSRM](http://www.project-osrm.org/) route responses into localized text instructions.

You can use OSRM Text Instructions in conjunction with [MapboxDirections.swift](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxDirections.swift/) and [MapboxNavigation.swift](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxNavigation.swift/) to generate visual and voice guidance in a turn-by-turn navigation application.

OSRM Text Instructions for Swift is based on the canonical [osrm-text-instructions](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions/) library written in JavaScript. Both versions are [translated at Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/project-osrm/osrm-text-instructions/) â€“ please help us add support for the languages you speak.
